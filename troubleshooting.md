# Troubleshooting DOI Resolutions

The CrossRef Export/Registration plugin will notify you of any configuration errors when attempting to deposit DOIs. Depending on the way that you deposit the DOIs, errors will be reported differently.

> Please note that PKP Developers are working on improved ways to determine the status of a DOI submission with CrossRef.
